# Project Setup

If you want, you can view this Readme in a nicer way by pressing Ctrl+Shift+V (or Cmd+Shift+V on macOS) to see a live preview. Otherwise, you can just read it here in your text editor.

Follow the steps below to get the project running. When it says bash, it means you should use the terminal to run the command. You do NOT need to write bash or ```.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer (you should have installed them both in earlier sessions so this may not be needed):

**Python**: You should already have this installed and so you should not need to do anything for this step. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

**Git**: This is required to clone the repository. You can download it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Before doing this, make sure you are not already inside another project folder eg a session from earlier this week in your terminal. If you are, you will need to navigate to the parent folder (by typing cd ..) and then clone the repository from there.

1. Clone repo:
   `git clone https://github.com/larathompson/breakthrough-python.git`

2. Navigate to the project and create a virtual environment:
   Note - a virtual environment is a way to easily setup all the dependencies for the project.

```bash
cd python-challenge
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

If the above has been successful, you should see (venv) âžœ python-challenge at the start of your terminal.

3.  This command will install all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. This will run the flask app. Flask is a web framework for python.

```bash
flask run
```

5. then visit http://localhost:5000

# Troubleshooting

If you get an error, try to fix it. If you can't, ask for help!

- check which version of python you are on. You can do this by running `python --version`
- check if you have venv installed. You can do this by running `python -m venv --help` Id you get an output then you have it installed. If you get an error, then there may be an issue with your Python installation.
- you can also try and troubleshoot using google

## What to do if you have the wrong version of python?

### For Mac users:

- Install pyenv: `brew install pyenv`
- Install Python 3.8 or higher: `pyenv install 3.8.10`
- Set local Python version: `pyenv local 3.8.10`
- Verify version: `python --version`
- Delete existing venv: `rm -rf venv`
- Create new venv: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### For Windows users:

- Download and install Python 3.8 or higher from python.org
- Remove existing venv folder: `rmdir /s /q venv`
- Update PATH environment variables if needed
- Verify version: `python --version`
- Create new venv: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate venv: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# If you really can't get it working..

- If you really can't get it working, then you can use the following link to access the repository here https://replit.com/@larathompson288/breakthrough-python
- you will need to create an account and then click the green "Fork" button (this will create a copy of the repository in your account)
- you can then click the "run" button to run the app
- then you can see the code and also the webview which shows how it would look live
- note when you make changes to the code, you will need to click the "run" button again to see the changes

# What is the project?

This is a simple web app that has various pages. It has a welcome page, a blog page and a countries page that allows you to view information about countries. It uses the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to get the data. During the project, you can edit both the backend and frontend code and make changes to the app.

# What do the different files do?

- `app.py` is the main file that runs the Flask app. It initializes the application and starts the server.
- `routes.py` is the file that defines the routes. Routes are the different URLs that the app can handle, and they determine what content is displayed when a user visits a specific URL.
- `requirements.txt` is the file that lists the dependencies. These are the external libraries and packages that the project needs to function correctly. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- `templates` is the folder that contains the HTML templates. These templates define the structure of the web pages.
- `static` is the folder that contains the static files. This is where the CSS, JavaScript, and image files are stored. These files help style the web pages and add interactivity.
- `seeds.py` contains sample data for the blog posts. You can add new blog posts, update existing ones, or add more fields like the author or the number of views.
- `country_service.py` is responsible for interacting with the REST Countries API. It fetches data about countries, which is then used to display information on the countries page of the web app.

# How does the code flow?

1. **Starting the Application**:

   - The application begins with `app.py`, which initializes the Flask app and starts the server. This file sets up the environment for the web application to run. Note that we are using Flask, which is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework designed for building web applications quickly and with minimal overhead. For the sake of this work, we do not need to worry about the details of Flask.

2. **Handling Requests**:

   - When a user visits a URL, `routes.py` determines which function should handle the request. Each route corresponds to a specific URL and is linked to a function that processes the request and returns a response.

3. **Fetching Data**:

   - If the request involves displaying country information, `country_service.py` is used to fetch data from the REST Countries API. This data is then processed and sent back to the user.

4. **Rendering Web Pages**:

   - The HTML templates in the `templates` folder are used to render the web pages. These templates are filled with data and sent to the user's browser to display the content.

5. **Styling and Interactivity**:

   - The `static` folder contains CSS and JavaScript files that style the web pages and add interactivity, such as animations or dynamic content updates.

6. **Managing Dependencies**:

   - The `requirements.txt` file lists all the external libraries needed for the project. These are installed in the virtual environment to ensure the app runs smoothly.

7. **Sample Data**:

   - `seeds.py` provides sample data for blog posts, which can be displayed on the blog page. This file can be modified to add or update blog content.

8. **CSS**:
   - `static/styles.css` is the file that controls the styles. This file is used to style the web pages.

This flow should help you understand how different parts of the codebase interact to create a functioning web application. If you have any specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask!

# Tasks

Remember - this is your project and a bit of an experimnent - try things out and see what happens and getting stuck is all part of the process!

Make sure to always check whether the app is still working as expected. You will errors on localhost:5000 if its not!
